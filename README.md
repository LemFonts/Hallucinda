# Hallucinda
 My typeface is inspired by «The Futurological Congress» by Stanisław Lem. This novel explores the topic of living in an illusion, the world in which it is no longer possible to distinguish reality from hallucination caused by drugs. Everyone believes in what they see, but is it real?   E-mail Natalia Błędowska
